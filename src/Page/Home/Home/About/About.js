                <p>I want to become a app developer.Currently I'm working on my react skills. I have worked with HTML, CSS and javascript for about 3 month. Now I want to work on react more as there are better growth opportunities.and also Planning on doing a certification in MERN stack so I can get into full stack development which I believe is going to be a great career choice for the future.I used to work from 8am-6pm, and then start learning to code from 8pm to 1am/2am for a few months. That was very challenging for me, but I needed to be highly focused and it worked out well because of that discipline.</p>
