                                        weddings, must come to an end. Six to seven hours is plenty of time to wine and dine
                                        your guests and dance the night away (start your event by 5 p.m. and have it end by
                                        midnight). The affair should end with a bang (and with your guests wanting more),
                                        rather than with a fizzle. Plus, you'll spend extra money on overtime staffing fees
